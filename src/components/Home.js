        A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers.
        Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and
        division mathematical calculations.However, more sophisticated calculators
        can handle exponential operations, square roots, logarithms, trigonometric
        functions and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators perform all
        these functions by repeated addition processes.
        Most calculators these days require electricity to operate or are battery-powered
        calculators. Calculators work by performing programmed functions based on numerical
        inputs.Before the electronic calculator (circa 1970), a more primitive calculator,
        the slide rule, was commonly used. It consisted of a slat of wood called the slide
        that could be moved in and out of a reinforced pair of slats. Both the slide and the
        outer pair of slats had calibrated numerical scales.
